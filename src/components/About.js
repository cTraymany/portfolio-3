                            I am a Laotian-American woman, a software developer, and a lifelong learner.
                            I have a background in retail and food service management as well as healthcare administration.
                            Being surrounded by the infinitely expanding tech scene, San Francisco played a role in my decision to transition to software engineering to pursue my passion for mentally stimulating and complex problem-solving.

                        <p>
                            I am a graduate of Flatiron School where I studied JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, RESTful APIs, software design patterns such as MVC, and a myriad of libraries and frameworks including Rails, Sinatra, React, and Redux. I like to build on my technical knowledge and dip my toes in several other learning opportunities that are available to me through the vast free resources of the internet.
                            I chose to become a software developer, and with this choice, I am more excited for the future than ever.
